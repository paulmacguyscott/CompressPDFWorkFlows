CompressPDFWorkFlows
====================

v1.0 Created Workflows of each of the PDF Compression Filters 	4/2/2012

After having several users complain about the size of PDF's created on the Mac I did some
research and found a a great set of Quartz Filters by Josh Carr. Installing them is as 
simple as copying the filters to the correct folder. 

Once that is done users wanted a one step solution to print the PDF's in the DPI and 
image quality of their choosing. 

First you install Josh's filters from https://github.com/joshcarr/Apple-Quartz-Filters
	Use the zip download and follow his instrutions to install them. 
	
Copy my Compress PDF Folder to either 
~/Library/PDF Services
or
/Libary/PDF Services

If you want only the Compress PDF options to appear for you use the first. Otherwise for
all users use the second. 

These work flows are designed to work with Josh Carr's Quartz Filters. Install the filters 
and then add these workflows to print PDF in the DPI and image quality of choice right 
from the print dialog.

If you have questions or suggestions please feel free to email me paul.scott@mac.com
